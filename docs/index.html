				Q2. The function styleAll creates a JavaScript object called styles that contains visual properties used by Leaflet to
				draw the features on the map (fill color, opacity, marker radius). The conditional
				statement checks the geometry type of the feature and applies settings only if the feature is a point. The function
				then returns the styles object so that Leaflet uses these values when drawing each feature.
			</p>
			<p>
				Q4. "feature" is the GeoJSON feature object (the data and attributes from the file). "layer" is the Leaflet map object
				created from that feature (the circle marker drawn on the map).
			</p>
			<p>
				Q5. layer.options.fill is a visual style setting that controls how the marker is drawn. layer.getLatLng() is a method
				that returns the geographic coordinates of the marker.
			</p>
			<p>
				Q6. The circles became much bigger and lost their color (transperent inside)
